# Federated Learning with Over-the-Air Computation and Continual Learning

This project explores and implements both **centralized** and **decentralized** Federated Learning (FL) paradigms, including extensions like:
- Over-the-Air (OTA) FL with noise injection
- Continual Learning using Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)
- Energy-aware client selection
- Multithreaded client simulation
- SOTA benchmarking and comparisons
